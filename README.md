# JPMORGAN-CHASE-Customer-Complaint-Analysis
##1. Introduction
This project analyzes the customer narrative complaint from JP Morgan Chase to find relationship between customer's emotion with complaint dispute rate. In this project, I compare the emotional content of disputed vs. non-disputed complaints to identify emotional patterns that might predict complaint resolution difficulty.
