## 1. Introduction
This project analyzes the customer narrative complaint from JP Morgan Chase to find relationship between customer's emotion with complaint dispute rate. In this project, I compare the emotional content of disputed vs. non-disputed complaints to identify emotional patterns that might predict complaint resolution difficulty.

## 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning Methodology
</br> This is the link to the data cleaning amd how I format the data for the future analysis: 
1. Tag columns includes multiple variables: Split tag columns into seperate rows if there are more than 2 tags
2. Standalize empty cells to NA format: Unified country name formats, standardized variations of USA/U.S.A to "United States" ,determined missing countries from locality information
3. Data Formatting: Converted all date column from varchar to date format
